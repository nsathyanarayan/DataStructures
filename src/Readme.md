# Algorithms and Data Structures ( C# and JS)

This repository contains popular algorithms and data structures. You can expect these algorithms in any software development interviews.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

* [Trie](data-structures/AutoComplete)

## Applications

Application project consists of example questions that you frequently encounter in major interviews.
This project consists of solution to following problems and unit tests to test the algorithms.

- [x] Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
- [x] Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
- [x] Implement a method to perform basic string compresssion using hte counts of repeated characters.
- [ ] Given an image represented by an NXN matrx, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, rotate the image by 90 degrees.
