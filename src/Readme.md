# Algorithms and Data Structures ( C# and JS)

This repository contains popular algorithms and data structures. You can expect these algorithms in any software development interviews.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.
